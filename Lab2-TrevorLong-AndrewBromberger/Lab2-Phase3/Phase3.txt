PID Requirements Analysis:

    x settling time: FAIL,
    x steady state error: PASS,
    x overshoot: FAIL,
    y settling time: FAIL,
    y steady state error: PASS,
    y overshoot: PASS,
    z settling time: PASS,
    z steady state error: FAIL,
    z overshoot: PASS,
    axis synchronization: FAIL

Time Spent Tuning: 3+ Hours

    Tuning took many more hours than anticipated in order to meet any of the requiremens.
    Once we received a fully functional Tello drone, the tuning went relatively quickly.
    (Same as PID)

    In general, the Pole-Placement method took siginificantly less time than the PID method, which makes it superior in contexts where design speed is critical.


Difficulty achieving requirements:

    As is evident from the analysis above, it was difficult to meet all of the requirements on the axes simultaneously.
    With our first Tello drone, it was almost impossible to get even one of the requirements to pass.
    Once we had a better drone, it became possible to meet some of the requirements but still very difficult to get simultaneous passes.
    (Same as PID)

Deisgn Rationale:

    The basic deisgn rationale for the Pole-placement controller was simple.
    We started with equal gains for each of the axes, chosen by using a 1.5x factor on the required gain for a settling time of 4 seconds (per the requirement).
    This gain was too high for all axes, so the axis gains were independently varied until the responses smoothed (oscillations stopped and overshoot decreased).
    For two of the axes, this resulted in a gain which mathematically results in too slow of settling, but this is a trade we had to make to acheive an appropriate response.
