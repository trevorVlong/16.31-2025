Lab2 Key Findings:

The preferred controller is the Pole-Placement controller.

    Although performance was similar in the initial tests using a diagonal step, pole-placement significantly outperformed PID in the cyclical trajectory tracking.
    Additionally, pole-placement was much easier to implement than PID tuning, since it only required varying three total gains instead of three per axis.
    Of course, this is specific to our particular pole-placement method, but in general, we expect pole-placement to be quicker than manual tuning.
    This is due to the mathematical nature of pole-placement as opposed to the trial-and-error approach of PID tuning.
    As we observed, the pole-placement method took less than 50% of the time of PID tuning.

Final Thoughts:

    We had significant technical difficulties with our lab hardware which prevented us from completeing this lab to the standard that we would have liked to achieve.
    Additionally, as one of the first groups to spend time on completing the lab, we were one of the first to run into several issues in the provided starter code.
    Though it is understandable that sometimes such errors might exist in the provided code, this did slow us down significantly and resulted in the lab consuming many more hours than is reasonable.
    In future labs, it would be ideal if the starter code is more thoroughly tested so that students are not responsible for debugging.
    We are confident that many other groups would have experienced more issues if we had not spent many hours determining issues with the starter code and sharing that information.
