    axis synchronization: FAIL

Time Spent Tuning: 10+ Hours

    Tuning took many more hours than anticipated in order to meet any of the requiremens.
    Once we received a fully functional Tello drone, the tuning went relatively quickly.

Difficulty achieving requirements:

    As is evident from the analysis above, it was difficult to meet all of the requirements on the axes simultaneously.
    With our first Tello drone, it was almost impossible to get even one of the requirements to pass.
    Once we had a better drone, it became possible to meet some of the requirements but still very difficult to get simultaneous passes.

Trade-offs Encountered:

    The main trade-off we encountered was with a fast response and avoiding oscillation.
    On our first hardware set, increasing from one gain to the next available gain in the set of Kp gains took our drone from underperforming immediately to instability.
    This was better on our later hardware on which the Kd gain worked correctly to reduce overshoot.
