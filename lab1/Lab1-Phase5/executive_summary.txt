Based on the experimental results:
- Has PID outperformed if-else control?
- What are the key advantages?
- Does this provide competitive advantage?

The PID control demonstrates much more desireable control characteristics than 
the heuristic controller. Most prominantly, the PID controller has a non-infinite settling time 
 (24s PID vs inf heuristic), final error (0.07m vs 0.48m) and rms error (.18m PID vs .32 heuristic) are 
 also much improved. In general these represent a controller that is asymptotically stable vs 
vs the heuristic controller which oscillates forever until the battery runs out without actually 
establishing an altitude.

The bang-bang controller did have some bright spots. The rise time is much faster than the PID
(.85s vs 3.8s) and the chattering is lower (44 heuristic vs 328 PID). That said chattering 
does not tell us the scale of the sign change and some might be very small on the PID controller.
Similarly, the faster rise time is not helpful if the controller does not actually converge to the 
desired altitude. 

Ultimately, many of the deficiencies of the PID controller can be tuned depending on the desired
charcteristics of the system while the bang bang controller does not really have any knobts to turn
to make it better.RECOMMENDATION:
