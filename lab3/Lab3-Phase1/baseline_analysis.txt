BASELINE CONTROLLER VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS

The baseline controller uses a simple proportional control law:
    v_z = K_p * (z_target - z_ToF)

where z_ToF is the direct reading from the Time-of-Flight sensor.

ATTACK SCENARIO:
When an adversary injects a +0.5m bias into the ToF sensor:
- True altitude: z_true
- Compromised reading: z_ToF = z_true + 0.5m

TODO: Complete this analysis
- Explain what happens when the controller uses the biased reading
- Provide mathematical example with numbers
- Explain why this causes a crash

YOUR ANALYSIS HERE:

When the controller receives a biased reading of +D, the pure P controller reacts s.t.
    dx/dt = Ax + B(Kx+KD)
    dx/dt = (A+BK)x + BKD
which means that the velocity command now has a constant shift. If near land or some other
~impermiable~ object this would certainly cause a crash. In more open environemtns it might
not be as much an issue depending on the scale of D, K.

In the case of this example a D = +0.5m and Kpz = 0.7 results in an altitude offset of -0.35m.
Since we are trying to land this would cause the drone controller to continue commanding a
large downward velocity as it believes it still needs to move downward to land.
