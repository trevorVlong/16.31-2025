BASELINE CONTROLLER VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS

The baseline controller uses a simple proportional control law:
    v_z = K_p * (z_target - z_ToF)

where z_ToF is the direct reading from the Time-of-Flight sensor.

ATTACK SCENARIO:
When an adversary injects a +0.5m bias into the ToF sensor:
- True altitude: z_true
- Compromised reading: z_ToF = z_true + 0.5m

TODO: Complete this analysis
- Explain what happens when the controller uses the biased reading
- Provide mathematical example with numbers
- Explain why this causes a crash
