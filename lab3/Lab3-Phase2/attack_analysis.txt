Answer the following questions based on your experimental data:

1. ATTACK TOLERANCE
===================

Q1: What is the maximum attack duration your system can tolerate while
    maintaining <15cm accuracy?

A1: up to 5s the controller appeared adequite

Q2: How does estimation error scale with attack duration? Is it linear,
    quadratic, or something else? Support with data.

A2: Error growth in attack_comparison.png clearly shows linear behavior once
the drift accumulation stabilizes. Slopes betwen 5s and 10s runs appear to be
similar or the same.

2. SYSTEM BEHAVIOR
==================

Q3: Describe what happens to the KF estimate during the attack window.
    Does it diverge immediately or gradually?

A3: The divergence is very gradual. At first it tracks well but then once errors
begin accumulating

Q4: When the attack ends and normal measurements resume, how quickly does
    the KF recover?

A4: KF recovers almost immediately to recovery of signal.

3. CONTROL IMPLICATIONS
========================

Q5: During the 10s attack test, did the drone's descent behavior become
    unsafe or unstable? Explain.

A5: Descent behavior never appeared to be come unsafe or unstable. In
the case of our controller, it appeared to hold altitude (not sure if
 that was a safety in the code that I missed).  There was nothing that
 looked like divergence, however.

Q6: For a real landing mission (5-8 seconds of descent), what attack
    duration could your system safely handle?


A6: 5s appears to be the maximum with the current requirements and is
    supported by attack_comparison.png. If the mission requirements were more
    relaxed it could probably handle roughly 10s before drift started to
    become dangerous to the hardware. Because the recovery is so fast as
    long as the drift area is not large the only real requirement is that
    this systme remain safe during that time.

4. FILTER TUNING
================

Q7: If you needed to increase attack tolerance from 5s to 10s, how would
    you modify the Q matrix? Explain your reasoning.

A7: [Your answer]

Q8: What is the tradeoff of decreasing Q to improve prediction-only
    performance? What might get worse?

A8: [Your answer]

5. CONCLUSIONS
==============

Based on your experiments, summarize:
- Maximum safe attack duration: 5 seconds
- Key limiting factor: Position uncertainty
- Recommendation for Phase 3: Maximum dropout/attack time of 5-8 s given current requirements

SUPPORTING DATA:
================
Include key numbers from your tests:
- 2s attack max error: 1 cm
- 5s attack max error: 14.4 cm
- 10s attack max error: 35.5 cm
