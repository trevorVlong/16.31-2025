Answer the following questions based on your experimental data:

1. ATTACK TOLERANCE
===================

Q1: What is the maximum attack duration your system can tolerate while
    maintaining <15cm accuracy?

A1: [Your answer]

Q2: How does estimation error scale with attack duration? Is it linear,
    quadratic, or something else? Support with data.

A2: [Your answer]

2. SYSTEM BEHAVIOR
==================

Q3: Describe what happens to the KF estimate during the attack window.
    Does it diverge immediately or gradually?

A3: [Your observations]

Q4: When the attack ends and normal measurements resume, how quickly does
    the KF recover?

A4: [Your observations]

3. CONTROL IMPLICATIONS
========================

Q5: During the 10s attack test, did the drone's descent behavior become
    unsafe or unstable? Explain.

A5: [Your observations]

Q6: For a real landing mission (5-8 seconds of descent), what attack
    duration could your system safely handle?

A6: [Your recommendation]

4. FILTER TUNING
================

Q7: If you needed to increase attack tolerance from 5s to 10s, how would
    you modify the Q matrix? Explain your reasoning.

A7: [Your answer]

Q8: What is the tradeoff of decreasing Q to improve prediction-only
    performance? What might get worse?

A8: [Your answer]

5. CONCLUSIONS
==============

Based on your experiments, summarize:
- Maximum safe attack duration: [X] seconds
- Key limiting factor: [e.g., "Velocity drift", "Position uncertainty"]
- Recommendation for Phase 3: [Your operational guidelines]

SUPPORTING DATA:
================
Include key numbers from your tests:
- 2s attack max error: [X] cm
- 5s attack max error: [X] cm  
- 10s attack max error: [X] cm
