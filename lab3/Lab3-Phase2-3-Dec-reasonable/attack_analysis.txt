Answer the following questions based on your experimental data:

1. ATTACK TOLERANCE
===================

Q1: What is the maximum attack duration your system can tolerate while
    maintaining <15cm accuracy?

A1: The maximum attack duration our system can tolerate while maintaining the required accuracy is approximately 5 seconds.

Q2: How does estimation error scale with attack duration? Is it linear,
    quadratic, or something else? Support with data.

A2: The error scales quadratically with attack duration, as the longer attack cases are much more severe than we would expect for a simple linear relationship. (5s - 12.3cm, 10s - 49.0cm).

2. SYSTEM BEHAVIOR
==================

Q3: Describe what happens to the KF estimate during the attack window.
    Does it diverge immediately or gradually?

A3: The KF estimate diverges gradually as the attack proceeds. The rate of divergence increases with time.

Q4: When the attack ends and normal measurements resume, how quickly does
    the KF recover?

A4: The KF recovers almost immediately after the attack ends.

3. CONTROL IMPLICATIONS
========================

Q5: During the 10s attack test, did the drone's descent behavior become
    unsafe or unstable? Explain.

A5: Yes, during the 10s attack test, the drone's behavior became unsafe, as the modeling was not able to track the true altitude over that period of time.

Q6: For a real landing mission (5-8 seconds of descent), what attack
    duration could your system safely handle?

A6: During a real landing mission (of 5-8s), the attack duration would have to be around the same as the time to land, as this is required to give the system enough time to recover after the attack or to land while the error is still not severe enough to cause unsafe landing.

4. FILTER TUNING
================

Q7: If you needed to increase attack tolerance from 5s to 10s, how would
    you modify the Q matrix? Explain your reasoning.

A7: Decreasing Q to trust the model more should decrease our drift and increase our attack time tolerance.

Q8: What is the tradeoff of decreasing Q to improve prediction-only
    performance? What might get worse?

A8: The consequence of decreasing Q is that the estimation will start to ignore actual measurement data in the scenarios where the system is not operating on predictions only.

5. CONCLUSIONS
==============

Based on your experiments, summarize:
- Maximum safe attack duration: 5 seconds
- Key limiting factor: Position Uncertainty
- Recommendation for Phase 3: Limit "attack" duration to the Maximum Sade Attack Duration

SUPPORTING DATA:
================
Include key numbers from your tests:
- 2s attack max error: 3.4 cm
- 5s attack max error: 12.3 cm  
- 10s attack max error: 49.0 cm
